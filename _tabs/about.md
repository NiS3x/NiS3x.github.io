Hello and welcome to my portfolio and blog!

My name is Pau Borda Carrasco, I am a 25-year-old hacker from Spain. This is where I occasionally will write my write-ups, CVEs, CTF solutions, vulnerability case studies, or anything related with cyber security.

My main skills are are Web, Infrastructure, Cloud Security, and Source Code reviews mainly in Mobile (iOS & Android) and JS frameworks.
